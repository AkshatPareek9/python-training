# Python Advanced Level Questions

  1. Multithreading v/s Multiprocessing
    
  - **Multithreading : One person doing many tasks at the same time by switching very fast.**
     
    Multithreading allows multiple threads to run inside a single process. They share the same memory.  

  - **Multiprocessing : Many person doing one-one task each at the same time.**

    Multiprocessing creates multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.
